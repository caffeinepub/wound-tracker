# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a wound assessment analyzer that evaluates healing progress through seven image-based metrics: area, perimeter, shape regularity, color composition, texture, edge sharpness, and moisture detection.

**Planned changes:**
- Create image upload interface for wound photographs
- Implement wound area measurement with healing interpretation
- Calculate perimeter and smoothness analysis
- Analyze shape regularity and circularity metrics
- Perform color composition analysis (red/pink/yellow/black percentages with clinical meanings)
- Detect texture smoothness
- Analyze edge sharpness and boundary definition
- Detect exudate and moisture appearance
- Build comprehensive results dashboard displaying all seven metrics with visual indicators
- Implement wound tracking history for comparing measurements over time
- Apply clean medical interface design with green/white color scheme

**User-visible outcome:** Users can upload wound images and receive detailed analysis across seven healing metrics with clinical interpretations, track healing progress over time through historical comparisons, and view all results in a professional medical dashboard interface.
